**Abstract**
--------

 - In my last exercise, I write program to see what is chaos. Now we know that at small value of $F_D$,such as 0.5, it shows simple oscillatory motion,however, at big value of $F_D$ like 1.2 it shows chaotic motion.For our deeper research, in this exercise I will focus on Poincare section and bifurcation diagram, which are linked to problem 3.18 and 3.20, to see internal principle of routes to chaos.
